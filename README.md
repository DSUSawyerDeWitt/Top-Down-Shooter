# Top-Down Shooter(Python + Pygame-CE)
A 2D shooter where you can shoot enemies and walk around in a larger map with object collisions, built using **Python** and **Pygame Community Edition**.
This was the first project I made that had an actual map, it helped me learn how to simlulate a camera, and create/animate players and enemies.
